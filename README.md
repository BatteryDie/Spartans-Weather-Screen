# Spartan's Weather Screen
This project showcases a 7-day weather forecast display on a website. Originally developed during my high school years, I revisited and enhanced it in 2022 by updating the CSS and JavaScript code to ensure compatibility with modern computers.

The website is optimized for a screen resolution of 1080p. You're welcome to fork or download the project and customize the `resources/styles/default.css` file to adjust the screen resolution according to your preferences.
