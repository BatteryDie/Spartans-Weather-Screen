# WeatherMachine 2.0
This is simply 7-days forecast display on the website. It was one of projects for my high school a very long time ago. On 2022, I improved it with updated CSS and JavaScript code.

The website is designed for 1080p screen resolution. Feel free to fork/download this project and edit `resources/styles/default.css` for screen resolution what you want.
